Phoenix Contexts were introduced 4 years ago, yet they still cause confusion to beginners and experienced developers alike. In this talk, we will examine the rationale for introducing Contexts, the pitfalls and how to avoid them.

If you're Twitter-inclined please let tonight's speakers know how much you appreciate the work they put in by tweeting about it. Giving feedback definitely makes the speakers feel their efforts have made an impact beyond building their own presentation portfolio.<br />
Don't forget to mention @ElixirSydney and @ElixirMelbourne to tie the night altogether. It also helps to fuel the hype for all our events, which is especially important and helpful for smaller events such as ours.

# [fit] We're on

# [fit] **YouTube!**

# [fit] `https://www.youtube.com/c/ElixirAustralia`

Elixir Australia now has a YouTube channel where recordings of talks from this meetup go up, and we're definitely happy to have videos uploaded from other Elixir meetups from around Australia, so if you are a regional meetup organiser or know one who has talk videos that need a home, please reach out.<br />
Either go to the URL you can see on the slide, or just do a search for Elixir Australia and you'll be sure to find us. If you haven't already, please subscribe cause we want to get up to 100 subs to get a vanity URL.
