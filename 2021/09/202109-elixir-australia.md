So if you're new to Elixir Sydney can you please put up your hand, don't worry we're not going to make you stand up or say anything. Everyone have a look around at any new people standing near you with their hands up. We're going to have a 5 minute break, so please welcome them, and we'll kick off the talks.

the meetup.

# [fit] Getting **up**
# [fit] and **running** with
# [fit] **PromEx**
# [fit] _Robert Ellen_
# [fit] **`@robertellen`**

^
Rob is going to talk about PromEx, a fantastic library that turns BEAM telemetry events into metrics that can be scraped by the Prometheus timeseries monitoring system. It also provides in-built Grafana charts that can be uploaded directly to a Grafana instance. Rob will walk through setting up a local PromEx environment including Prometheus and Grafana with Docker to show how quickly you can get some metrics going in your Elixir applications.

# [fit] _Qing Wu_
# [fit] **`@wiserfirst`**

^
Phoenix 1.6 RC0 was released just two weeks ago and, like all of us I'm sure, Qing is very excited about it.
Over this last weekend, Qing managed to upgrade a little side project of his to Phoenix 1.6, so he'll share his upgrade journey with us.

If you're Twitter-inclined please let tonight's speakers know how much you appreciate the work they put in by tweeting about it. Giving feedback definitely makes the speakers feel their efforts have made an impact beyond building their own presentation portfolio.<br />
Don't forget to mention @ElixirSydney and @ElixirMelbourne to tie the night altogether. It also helps to fuel the hype for all our events, which is especially important and helpful for smaller events such as ours.
