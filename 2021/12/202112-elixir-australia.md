Welcome to Elixir Australia

# [fit] Who's **New?**
# [fit] *Say* **_Hello!_** :wave:

So if you're new to Elixir Sydney can you please put up your hand, don't worry we're not going to make you stand up or say anything. Everyone have a look around at any new people standing near you with their hands up. We're going to have a 5 minute break, so please welcome them, and we'll kick off the talks.

the meetup.

If you're Twitter-inclined please let tonight's speakers know how much you appreciate the work they put in by tweeting about it. Giving feedback definitely makes the speakers feel their efforts have made an impact beyond building their own presentation portfolio.<br />
Don't forget to mention @ElixirSydney and @ElixirMelbourne to tie the night altogether. It also helps to fuel the hype for all our events, which is especially important and helpful for smaller events such as ours.

# [fit] We're on
# [fit] **YouTube!**
# [fit] `https://www.youtube.com/c/ElixirAustralia`

^
Elixir Australia has a YouTube channel, complete with a vanity URL, where recordings of talks from this meetup go up, and we're definitely happy to have videos uploaded from other Elixir meetups from around Australia, so if you are a regional meetup organiser or know one who has talk videos that need a home, please reach out.<br />

# [fit] **Thank you!**

The next meetup will be next year, February 16, 2022, as we take a break in January, still online for now. Anyone wanting to fulfill their 2022 new year's resolutions for doing an Elixir tech talk has two months to come up with something, so we look forward to your submissions! In the meantime, enjoy your year end break, stay safe, and we hope to see you again when we kick off Elixir meetups again in 2022!
