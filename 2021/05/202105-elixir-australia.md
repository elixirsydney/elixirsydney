So if you're new to Elixir Sydney can you please put up your hand, don't worry we're not going to make you stand up or say anything. Everyone have a look around at any new people standing near you with their hands up. We're going to have a 5 minute break, so please welcome them, and we'll kick off the talks.

Robin will give a brief introduction to the world of autonomous aircraft, autopilots, onboard companion computers, ground stations and communication links. He will demonstrate the use of his open source Elixir MAVLink library to communicate with an Ardupilot autopilot from Elixir code, which in turn will control an accurate X-Plane simulation of a large UAV he has been working with since 2014

If you're Twitter-inclined please let tonight's speakers know how much you appreciate the work they put in by tweeting about it. Giving feedback definitely makes the speakers feel their efforts have made an impact beyond building their own presentation portfolio.<br />
Don't forget to mention @ElixirSydney and @ElixirMelbourne to tie the night altogether. It also helps to fuel the hype for all our events, which is especially important and helpful for smaller events such as ours.

# [fit] *Next Meetup's* **_Exercism_**
# [fit] **Rotational Cipher**
### *`exercism download --exercise=rotational-cipher --track=elixir`*

^
- Create an implementation of the rotational cipher, also sometimes called the Caesar cipher.
-The Caesar cipher is a simple shift cipher that relies on transposing all the letters in the alphabet using an integer key between 0 and 26. Using a key of 0 or 26 will always yield the same output due to modular arithmetic. The letter is shifted for as many values as the value of the key.
