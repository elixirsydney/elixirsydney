So if you're new to Elixir Sydney can you please put up your hand, don't worry we're not going to make you stand up or say anything. Everyone have a look around at any new people standing near you with their hands up. We're going to have a 5 minute break, so please welcome them, and we'll kick off the talks.

the meetup.

# [fit] **`@ElixirSydney` / `@ElixirMelbourne`**

^
If you're Twitter-inclined please let tonight's speakers know how much you appreciate the work they put in by tweeting about it. Giving feedback definitely makes the speakers feel their efforts have made an impact beyond building their own presentation portfolio.<br />
Don't forget to mention @ElixirSydney and @ElixirMelbourne to tie the night altogether. It also helps to fuel the hype for all our events, which is especially important and helpful for smaller events such as ours.

# [fit] Next Meetup
# [fit] **November 17, 2021**
# [fit] _\(3rd Wednesday of the month\)_

^
The next meetup will be on November 17, 2021, still online for now. I think we may end up being a bit cautious about in person events...
So, stay safe, get vaxxed if you can, and thanks for coming along and we hope to see you next month for the next instalment of Elixir Australia!
