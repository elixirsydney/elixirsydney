Since Zoom chat is ephemeral, we're going to use the #australia channel on the
Elixir lang Slack, so follow along there for internal chatter during and after
the meetup.

# [fit] Thanks to our
# [fit] **Sponsors**

^
First of all, I'd just like to thank our sponsor, who help make Elixir Sydney as objectively awesome as it is.<br />
Sending pizza and drinks to all of your homes wasn't really possible, so no sponsors of that nature, but...

# [fit] **`https://repl.it/`**

^
We're going to try using https://repl.it/ in this scenario so we can have a live, shared code editor and repl. So, if you haven't already signed up for a Repl account and you want to participate directly in the live coding session, then please rush over to repl.it and do so.

If you're Twitter-inclined please let tonight's speakers know how much you appreciate the work they put in by tweeting about it. Giving feedback definitely makes the speakers feel their efforts have made an impact beyond building their own presentation portfolio.<br />
Don't forget to mention @ElixirSydney and @ElixirMelbourne to tie the night altogether. It also helps to fuel the hype for all our events, which is especially important and helpful for smaller events such as ours.

<br />
# [fit] Who's **New?**
# [fit] *Say* **_Hello!_** :wave:

^
So if you're new to Elixir Sydney can you please put up your hand, don't worry we're not going to make you stand up or say anything.  Everyone have a look around at any new people standing near you with their hands up. We're going to have a 5 minute break, so please welcome them, and we'll kick off the talks.

# [fit] Next Meetup
# [fit] **June sometime**
# [fit] *\(should we do this again?\)*

^
The next meetup will be in June sometime. Our combined meetup this month was a bit of an experiment to get all Australian Elixirists in one place while we're all doing meetups online and physical geography isn't relevant.<br />
So, should we do this again, or continue with our region-focused meetups? If you have any feedback, please let us know by reaching out to the meetup organisers.<br />
Thanks for coming along and we hope to see you next month in whatever format these meetups end up taking!
