Welcome to Elixir Australia

Since Zoom chat is ephemeral, we're going to use the #australia channel on the
Elixir lang Slack, so follow along there for internal chatter during and after
the meetup.

# [fit] Thanks to our
# [fit] **Sponsors**

^
First of all, I'd just like to thank our sponsors, who help make Elixir Australia as objectively awesome as it is.<br />

# [fit] **Haskell**
# [fit] as **Elixir**
# [fit] *Julian Doherty*
# [fit] **`@madlep`**

^
First up, Julian is going to talk about how we can abuse macros and Elixir type specs to build a DSL that sort of gives us some of the same conciseness and elegance of Haskell's rich type system in Haskell as Elixir.

If you're Twitter-inclined please let tonight's speakers know how much you appreciate the work they put in by tweeting about it. Giving feedback definitely makes the speakers feel their efforts have made an impact beyond building their own presentation portfolio.<br />
Don't forget to mention @ElixirSydney and @ElixirMelbourne to tie the night altogether. It also helps to fuel the hype for all our events, which is especially important and helpful for smaller events such as ours.

# [fit] We're on
# [fit] **YouTube!**

Elixir Australia now has a YouTube channel where recordings of talks from this meetup go up, and we're definitely happy to have videos uploaded from other Elixir meetups from around Australia, so if you are a regional meetup organiser or know one who has talk videos that need a home, please reach out.<br />
Either go to the URL you can see on the slide, or just do a search for Elixir Australia and you'll be sure to find us.

# [fit] Who's **New?**
# [fit] *Say* **_Hello!_** :wave:

^
So if you're new to Elixir Sydney can you please put up your hand, don't worry we're not going to make you stand up or say anything.  Everyone have a look around at any new people standing near you with their hands up. We're going to have a 5 minute break, so please welcome them, and we'll kick off the talks.
