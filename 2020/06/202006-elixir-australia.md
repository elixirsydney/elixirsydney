the meetup.

If you're Twitter-inclined please let tonight's speakers know how much you appreciate the work they put in by tweeting about it. Giving feedback definitely makes the speakers feel their efforts have made an impact beyond building their own presentation portfolio.<br />
Don't forget to mention @ElixirSydney and @ElixirMelbourne to tie the night altogether. It also helps to fuel the hype for all our events, which is especially important and helpful for smaller events such as ours.

# [fit] Who's **New?**
# [fit] *Say* **_Hello!_** :wave:

^
So if you're new to Elixir Sydney can you please put up your hand, don't worry we're not going to make you stand up or say anything.  Everyone have a look around at any new people standing near you with their hands up. We're going to have a 5 minute break, so please welcome them, and we'll kick off the talks.

# [fit] **Thank you!**

Thanks so much to all the speakers tonight, and if anyone is interested in giving a talk at a future Elixir event...

# [fit] *Next Meetup's* **_Exercism_**
# [fit] **Armstrong Numbers**
### *`exercism download --exercise=armstrong-numbers --track=elixir`*

^
An Armstrong number is a number that is the sum of its own digits each raised to the power of the number of digits.<br />
For example:<br />
9 is an Armstrong number, because 9 = 9^1 = 9<br />
10 is not an Armstrong number, because 10 != 1^2 + 0^2 = 1<br />
Write a function to convert from normal numbers to Roman Numerals.

# [fit] **FREE LiveView Course**

## `https://pragmaticstudio.com/phoenix-liveview`

^
If you haven't had the chance to delve into LiveView to see what all the fuss is out, I can highly recommend having a look at Pragmatic Studio's free LiveView course. It's still in development, but they've released 6 videos, including a great intro video that explains, with cool moving diagrams, what LiveView is at a high level and where it's benefits are. They had Jose Valim do technical reviews on the course, so they are legit.

# [fit] Next Meetup
# [fit] **July 15, 2020**
# [fit] *\(3rd Wednesday of the month\)*

^
The next meetup will be in July 15. Our combined meetup last month was a success, we think, in getting a lot of Elixirists in our timezone in one place while we're all doing meetups online and physical geography isn't relevant.<br />
So, we'll be continuing with this format, at least while in-person meetups are not possible.
Anyway, thanks for coming along and we hope to see you next month for the 3rd installment of Elixir Australia!
