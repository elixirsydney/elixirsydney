the meetup.

Tonight, we have Robin Hilliard, who will talk about how easy it is to make mistakes with measurement units, especially when you're mixing imperial and metric, and his attempt to deal with this problem.<br />
He will talk about:<br />
- Simple Elixir data structures that model relationships between units (inches, cm, feet are all lengths) and dimensions (length, area, time, acceleration, power, ...)<br />
- A technique for handling distinct error cases in with statements and<br />
- Show how straight forward it is to extend the built in arithmetic operators in Elixir.

If you're Twitter-inclined please let tonight's speakers know how much you appreciate the work they put in by tweeting about it. Giving feedback definitely makes the speakers feel their efforts have made an impact beyond building their own presentation portfolio.<br />
Don't forget to mention @ElixirSydney and @ElixirMelbourne to tie the night altogether. It also helps to fuel the hype for all our events, which is especially important and helpful for smaller events such as ours.

Either go to the URL you can see on the slide, or just do a search for Elixir Australia and you'll be sure to find us.

# [fit] Who's **New?**
# [fit] *Say* **_Hello!_** :wave:

So if you're new to Elixir Sydney can you please put up your hand, don't worry we're not going to make you stand up or say anything.  Everyone have a look around at any new people standing near you with their hands up. We're going to have a 5 minute break, so please welcome them, and we'll kick off the talks.

# [fit] *Next Meetup's* **_Exercism_**
# [fit] **Armstrong Numbers**
### *`exercism download --exercise=armstrong-numbers --track=elixir`*

^
An Armstrong number is a number that is the sum of its own digits each raised to the power of the number of digits.<br />
For example:<br />
9 is an Armstrong number, because 9 = 9^1 = 9<br />
10 is not an Armstrong number, because 10 != 1^2 + 0^2 = 1<br />
Write a function to convert from normal numbers to Roman Numerals.

# [fit] **FREE LiveView Course**

## `https://pragmaticstudio.com/phoenix-liveview`

^
If you haven't had the chance to delve into LiveView to see what all the fuss is out, I can highly recommend having a look at Pragmatic Studio's free LiveView course. It's still in development, but they've released 6 videos, including a great intro video that explains, with cool moving diagrams, what LiveView is at a high level and where it's benefits are. They had Jose Valim do technical reviews on the course, so they are legit.

# [fit] Next Meetup

# [fit] *\(3rd Wednesday of the month\)*

^
The next meetup will be in August 19. So, we'll still be continuing with this format, at least while in-person meetups are not possible and parts of Australia are in lockdown.
Anyway, thanks for coming along and we hope to see you next month for the next installment of Elixir Australia!
