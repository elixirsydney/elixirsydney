# [fit] *Next Meetup's* **_Exercism_**
# [fit] **Grade School**
### *`exercism download --exercise=grade-school --track=elixir`*

^
Since we didn't have a volunteer this month, we're going to re-use it for next February, so you've got lots of time to solve the problem now.
Given students' names along with the grade that they are in, create a roster for the school.<br />
In the end, you should be able to:<br />
Add a student's name to the roster for a grade<br />
Get a list of all students enrolled in a grade<br />
Get a sorted list of all students in all grades. Grades should sort as 1, 2, 3, etc., and students within a grade should be sorted alphabetically by name.

# [fit] Next Meetup
# [fit] **5 February 2020**
# [fit] *\(1st Wednesday of the month\)*

^
The next meetup will be on the 5th February, since we want a month off and the schedule would have put the meetup on New Year's Day, and I'm pretty sure you'll all be busy with other things. But regardless, we hope you enjoyed tonight so much that you'll want to come back again.<br />
For anyone that wants to continue the conversation, feel free to come over to the Angel pub.<br />
Please make sure to clean up after yourself and put your plates in the rubbish bins and empty bottles in the recycling bins. Thanks for coming along and we hope to see you next year!
