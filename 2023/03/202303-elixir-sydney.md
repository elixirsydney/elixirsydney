If you're Twitter-inclined please let tonight's speakers know how much you appreciate the work they put in by tweeting about it. Giving feedback definitely makes the speakers feel their efforts have made an impact beyond building their own presentation portfolio.<br />
Don't forget to mention @ElixirSydney to tie the night altogether. It also helps to fuel the hype for all our events, which is especially important and helpful for smaller events such as ours.
