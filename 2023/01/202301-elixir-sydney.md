So if you're new to Elixir Sydney can you please put up your hand, don't worry we're not going to make you stand up or say anything. Everyone have a look around at any new people standing near you with their hands up. We're going to have a 5 minute break, so please welcome them, and we'll kick off the talks.

Elixir lang Slack, so follow along there for internal chatter during and after
the meetup.

# [fit] _SaÅ¡a_
# [fit] _JuriÄ‡_

^
First up is SaÅ¡a JuriÄ‡, with Concurrency in Action, where he will challenge the opinion that concurrency is hard, and should be avoided as much as possible. He'll show that writing highly concurrent programs doesn't have to be very difficult, and that it can even be fun!

If you're Twitter-inclined please let tonight's speakers know how much you appreciate the work they put in by tweeting about it. Giving feedback definitely makes the speakers feel their efforts have made an impact beyond building their own presentation portfolio.<br />
Don't forget to mention @ElixirSydney to tie the night altogether. It also helps to fuel the hype for all our events, which is especially important and helpful for smaller events such as ours.

# [fit] **Thank you!**

Thanks so much to all the speakers tonight, and if anyone is interested in giving a talk at a future Elixir event...
