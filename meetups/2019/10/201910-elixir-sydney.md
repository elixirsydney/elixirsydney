If you're Twitter-inclined please let tonight's speakers know how much you appreciate the work they put in by tweeting about it. Giving feedback definitely makes the speakers feel their efforts have made an impact beyond building their own presentation portfolio.<br />
Don't forget to mention @sydneyelixir to tie the night altogether. It also helps to fuel the hype for this event, which is especially important and helpful for smaller events such as ours.

# [fit] Who's **New?**
# [fit] *Say* **_Hello!_** :wave:

^
So if you're new to Elixir Sydney can you please put up your hand, don't worry we're not going to make you stand up or say anything.  Everyone have a look around at any new people standing near you with their hands up. We're going to have a 5 minute break, so please welcome them, and we'll kick off the talks.

# [fit] *Next Meetup's* **_Exercism_**
# [fit] **Nucleotide Count**
### *`exercism download --exercise=nucleotide-count --track=elixir`*

^
By counting the number of differences between two homologous DNA strands taken from different genomes with a common ancestor, we get a measure of the minimum number of point mutations, or "mistakes", that could have occurred on the evolutionary path between the two strands.<br />
This is called the 'Hamming distance', and your challenge is to calculate it.
