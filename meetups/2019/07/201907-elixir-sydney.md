If you're Twitter-inclined please let tonight's speakers know how much you appreciate the work they put in by tweeting about it. Giving feedback definitely makes the speakers feel their efforts have made an impact beyond building their own presentation portfolio. Don't forget to mention @sydneyelixir to tie the night altogether. It also helps to fuel the hype for this event, which is especially important and helpful for smaller events such as ours.

# [fit] *Who's* **_New?_**
# [fit] *Say* **_Hello!_** :wave:

So if you're new to Elixir Sydney can you please put up your hand, don't worry we're not going to make you stand up or say anything.  Everyone have a look around at any new people standing near you with their hands up. We're going to have a 5 minute break, so please welcome them, and we'll kick off the talks.

# [fit] *Elixir 1.9*
# [fit] **_Released!_**

# [fit] `https://elixir-lang.org/blog/2019/06/24/elixir-v1-9-0-released/`

^
A release is a self-contained directory that consists of your application code, all of its dependencies, plus the whole Erlang Virtual Machine (VM) and runtime. Once a release is assembled, it can be packaged and deployed to a target as long as the target runs on the same operating system (OS) distribution and version as the machine running the mix release command.<br />
Releases are the last planned feature for Elixir the language, but the core team will be shipping new releases every 6 months with enhancements, bug fixes and improvements.

# [fit] *Phoenix LiveView*
# [fit] **_`pushState`_**

# [fit] `https://www.poeticoding.com/phoenix-liveview-change-the-url-without-refreshing-the-page/`

^
Itâ€™s now possible to try the pushState support available in Phoenix LiveView<br />
With Phoenix LiveView we can easily update parts of the page without having to change the location, refreshing the page or directly use JavaScript.<br />
But when the page's content changes, the URL remains the same, making it difficult for a user to bookmark or share the current page state.<br />
The Phoenix LiveView pushstate support (with live_link/2 and live_redirect/2) solves exactly this problem. While changing the page content we can now dynamically update the URL without a page refresh.
