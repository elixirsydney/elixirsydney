# Background and motivation

---
# REST is great

* HTTP transport (request/response)
* JSON data representation (vs XML)
* Resource oriented (easy to model)

---
# REST is webby

* URL based (easy to develop against/debug)
* APIs work like the web does
* Discoverability
* Caching for free
* Obvious how it works (for web devs)

---
# REST is *hard* in practice

* Big upfront design required
  - need to anticipate all future clients and their needs
  - impossible to get right
* Hard to change (versioning problems)
* Maintainability issues

---
# REST is *hard* in practice

* No one true way to do REST
* Badly designed APIs can significantly hamper the design of great frontends
* No type information
  - `user` and `friend` are different resources but share some interface
* Single way to describe relationship hierarchy (ie nesting)

---
# REST is *hard* in practice

* Poor performance (1 + N resource traversals)
  - fetch user, then fetch friends, then fetch pets
* or complex handrolled API to batch requests

`GET /users/1/friends/1/pets/1?include=user.name,friend.name,pet.age`

---
# REST limitations part 1

* REST assumes that like the web the client hasn't ever seen API before
    - Internal mobile/web clients saw it <10ms ago
* Can't easily model realtime updates via server push
    - HTTP 2.0 / Websockets
    - realtime web is coming

---
# REST limitations part 2

* Too much overhead for tightly coupled clients & servers
    - clients traversing resource tree need to make > 1 request in serial
    - dynamic traversals
* No one true way means lot's of handrolled code and documentation

---
# Complex query in REST

`GET /users/1/friends/1/pets/1?include=user.name,friend.name,dog.age`

---
# Complex query in GraphQL

```
{
  user(id: 1) {
    name
    friends {
      name
      pets {
        age
      }
    }
  }
}
```

---
# What is GraphQL?

---
# What is GraphQL?

* It's a *specification* for client/server interaction
* Language independent
* A DSL for defining queries for data
* A DSL for defining data types in a schema
* A specification for the query execution engine

---
# What is GraphQL?

* Strongly typed
* Super flexible
* Queries are declarative
* They have the same shape as the response
* Queries can provide all data required by view in single query

---
# What GraphQL is not

* Nothing to do with graphs
* Not language specific (many implementations)

---
# Properties of GraphQL core

* Accepts queries and executes them against a schema
* Not tied to HTTP, JSON or data store
* Single `GraphQLexecute(schema, query)` function

---
# Plug GraphQL

* Single endpoint (entire API at a single URL)
* GET or POST queries
* POST mutations
* Websockets for subscriptions

---
# Lifecycle of a query

* Parse query to AST
    - we use leex and yecc
* Validation of query
    - ie fields which don't match schema data types
* Execution of query
    - executes resolve functions for each required data type or field
* Returns result (or errors)

---
# Simple Schema

```elixir
%Schema{
  query: %ObjectType{
    name: "SimpleQuery",
    fields: %{
      greeting: %{
        type: %String{},
        resolve: fn (_, _, _) -> "Hello, world!" end
      }
    }
  }
}
```

---
# Simple Query

### Query

```js
{ greeting }
```

### JSON response

```js
{
  "data": {
    "greeting": "Hello, World!"
  }
}
```

---
# Data Access Schema

```elixir
@items %{"a" => %{id: "a", name: "Foo"}, "b" => %{id: "b", name: "Bar"}}

%Schema{
  query: %ObjectType{
    fields: %{
      item: %{
        type: %Item{},
        args: %{id: %{type: %String{}}},
        resolve: fn(_, %{id: id}, _) -> Map.get(@items, id) end
      }
    }
  }
}
```

---
# Data Access Query

### Query

```js
{
  item(id: "a") {
    id
    name
  }
}
```

### JSON response

```js
{
  "data": {
    "id": "a",
    "name": "Foo"
  }
}
```
