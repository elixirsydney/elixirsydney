the meetup.

# [fit] **Gleam**
# [fit] in a week
# [fit] **Here's how it went**
# [fit] _Theo Harris_
# [fit] **`@dino_coder`**

^
After being dragged into the Gleam community discord server, Theo Harris found a tight-knit community who were passionate about their language. So, he decided to learn Gleam in the span of a week and share his experience with other devs who also have an Elixir background. Do he have any idea what he's doing? You will find out soon!

If you're Twitter-inclined please let tonight's speakers know how much you appreciate the work they put in by tweeting about it. Giving feedback definitely makes the speakers feel their efforts have made an impact beyond building their own presentation portfolio.<br />
Don't forget to mention @ElixirSydney to tie the night altogether. It also helps to fuel the hype for all our events, which is especially important and helpful for smaller events such as ours.

# [fit] **Thank you!**

Thanks so much to all the speakers tonight, and if anyone is interested in giving a talk at a future Elixir event...
