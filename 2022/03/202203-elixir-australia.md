the meetup.

Our speakers tonight will be Theo and Ana, who will give a talk about their "simple" starter project while learning Elixir, where they decided to rebuild Wordle using a combination of Elixir, Phoenix Liveview, and TailwindCSS. It will be a showcase of the lessons learned, the overall process, and some of the tricky bits that popped up along the way. Of course, we'll also play a game of Wordle, so get your dictionaries ready!

If you're Twitter-inclined please let tonight's speakers know how much you appreciate the work they put in by tweeting about it. Giving feedback definitely makes the speakers feel their efforts have made an impact beyond building their own presentation portfolio.<br />
Don't forget to mention @ElixirSydney to tie the night altogether. It also helps to fuel the hype for all our events, which is especially important and helpful for smaller events such as ours.
